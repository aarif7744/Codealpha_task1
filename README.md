## Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of the NSEI (National Stock Exchange of India) using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook and Pycharm IDE for web page.

## Overview
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of financial markets. In this project, we leverage the power of LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies in stock price data, enabling us to make informed predictions.

## Features
Data Collection: Fetches historical stock price data for NSEI.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and creates sequences for LSTM input.
Model Building: Constructs and trains an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Prediction: Makes future stock price predictions based on the trained model.
Visualization: Plots the actual vs. predicted stock prices for performance evaluation.

## Usage
Open the stock_prediction.ipynb notebook.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to fetch data, preprocess it, build and train the LSTM model, and make predictions.
Visualize the results and evaluate the model performance.
